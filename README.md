# ng_AGC FPGA Version of Apollo Guidance Computer

The AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) was a very early computer, designed in 1964, it was the first to use Integrated Circuits and the first modern embedded processor. When I was growing up, about 11 years old, I remember the Apollo program was fascinating to me and I had my eyesglued to the TV for days on end. The Moon landing made such a lasting impression on me that it is why I decided to go to engineering school and get a degree in Electrical Engineering.

Recently I saw a link to John Pultorak’s replica computer he built in tribute to the AGC. I was incredibly impressed with his accomplishment. It is built completely out of discrete TTL IC’s, all in wire wrap, more advanced than what was available in the ‘60’s but old by today’s standards. I think it was a fantastic achievement on his part and I applaud what he did. I also think I understand the retro-tech thinking on his part of using the oldest technology possible. But another retro-tech perspective is to adapt the latest technology to the old (or vice versa). I know that there are a number of efforts around Virtual AGC’s, that is emulators that run on PC’s. These are also very cool. I think a few people have messed around with an FPGA version, but I did not see a lot of work on that front. Also, I just thought it would be a fun and interesting project that would also be a learning experience.
